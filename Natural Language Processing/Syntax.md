THE STRUCTURE OF LANGUAGE
arrangement of words and phrases to create well formed sentences in a language
set of rules governing the structure and sentences, ensuring the words combine in a meaningful and grammatically correct ways

Understanding syntax is crucial for various NLP tasks - parsing, machine translation, question answering

Key Concepts:
- [[Constituents]] : Sentences are not merely linear string of words but acts as a single unit within the sentence.  'the black cat' can be broken down to smaller units, creating a tree-like structure. This concept is central to formal grammars like Context-Free Grammars (CFGs

- Grammatical Relations: Syntax define the relationships between words in a sentence such as object subject and modifier. this help determine the meaning of sentences and huide parsing algorithms in analysing sentence structure
- Word Classes [[POS Tagging]] : Categorizing words into respective parts of speech (nouns, vers, adjectives, adverbs) is fundamental un syntactic analysis. List of POS is provided by a tagsets including the Penn Treebank tagset
- Formal Grammars: math model describes the rule of language's syntax. CFG consists of riles that define how non-terminal symbols (phrases) can be expanded into sequences of terminal symbols
