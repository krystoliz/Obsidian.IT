Semantics focus on the meaning of linguistic expresions
Syntactically well-formed sentence doesn't guarantee meaningfulness, and conversely, meaning can sometimes be conveyed despite syntactically irregularities. Syntax acts as a framework for understanding how word combines

The cat sat on the mat (syntactically correct)
Sat mat on the cat the (syntactically incorrect)
- Phrase structure. sentence parsing, and grammar frameworks

The cat sat on the mat
The idea sleeps on the cow (grammatically correct but semantically nonsensical)

Semantic key concepts: word sense, meaning representation, ambiguity

#### Word Meaning
meanings of individual words and relationships between them
- words senses, relationships between words, connotation
#### Sentence Meaning
how words combine to create meaning
- predicate-argument structure
- formal meaning representations
- discourse meaning (how sentences connect and contribute to a coherent whole)
